## How can I help?

Given limited availability, I prioritize consulting projects where I can have the greatest impact — typically those that are both challenging and aligned with my expertise.

On a high level, my areas of expertise span **product**, **usability**, and **web architecture**.
This includes:
- Web standards and web platform design, especially CSS
- Product design, strategy, and vision for products targeting web developers and designers
- API design for the Web
- Open source software and open standards
- Color science, especially as it relates to web technologies
- Web Components
- Design systems and design tokens, especially around their use for Web UIs
- Qualitative and quantitative research methods

My involvement can take many forms, depending on what fits your needs and budget.
For example:
- Short, [one-off mentorship sessions](#one-hour-session)
- [Design reviews](#design-reviews) and audits of products or APIs (existing or 0→1)
- Short- or medium-term research projects to explore a specific problem, investigate user needs in a specific area, or drive web standards forwards through developer evangelism
- Coaching sessions
- Joining your company Slack for async help
- On-site or remote sessions or workshops tailored to your team’s needs
- Talks and articles (for conferences, magazines, etc.)
- Fractional positions (technical fellow, product manager, etc) when you need expertise on an ongoing basis but not a full-time hire

These are only examples, and I’m very open to discussing other ways my expertise can add value and help you out.
Unusual projects are often the most interesting.
Just <a class="contact">drop me an email</a> and we can discuss.

Rates do vary by scope, project type, and length, and I do offer a sliding scale for nonprofit organizations, or organizations in low-income countries, and projects with strong social impact or that provide public benefit.
Please <a class="contact">reach out</a> for more details, and to discuss what’s feasible for your budget.

## 1 Hour Mentorship Session { #one-hour-session }

If you have a specific problem you need help with, I can help you out in a one-off mentorship session.
You pay **$500**, get one hour of my time and you can use it as you see fit.
We can brainstorm solutions to a specific problem, you can ask me about web standards or a CSS feature you struggle with,
or anything else you want to discuss that is relevant to my experience and/or areas of expertise.
You can bring only yourself, or your entire team.
There are no guarantees or deliverables.

**I’m currently gauging interest in these sessions.**
Please enter your email below to be notified when they become available:

## Web Platform Consulting & Education

Many companies see web technologies (CSS, HTML, etc.) as something handed down from the gods on stone tablets.
Or, maybe they understand that that is not the case, but the web standards process seems opaque and intimidating.
As a result, they invest so much time and effort working around [web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform) limitations (or perceived limitations)
that it would actually be **much cheaper to fix the core problem instead**.

### Web Platform Consulting

I will listen to your team’s pain points around a specific area and we’ll take it from there,
depending on whether a solution already exists, and what its implementation status is if so.

Often, it turns out that better solutions already exist in the web platform and are widely implemented, but the team is not aware of them.
This is not a fault with the team; the web platform moves so fast that _no_ development team can keep up with it.
In that case, this will turn into an  **education** session,
where I will explain the existing solutions, their tradeoffs, and how to utilize them to address your pain points (which is often non-obvious).
Often, this is all that is needed.

Other times, solutions do exist, but they are not implemented in all browsers yet.
In these cases, there are options:
- **Progressive enhancement**: Many web features can add value even before they are implemented in all browsers, through progressive enhancement.
- **Polyfills** can fill the gap for browsers that do not implement the feature yet, and I can help you find or build one that meets your needs.
- **Driving implementation**: If you are invested in getting these features implemented across browsers, there are two core avenues:
  1. Driving developer interest to put pressure on browser vendors through evangelism, polyfills, etc. More affordable, but also slower and less certain.
  2. Funding implementation work directly. Costlier, but faster and more certain. I can help you navigate options for this and interface with the companies doing that kind of work.

Lastly, sometimes there is no existing solution.
In that case, I can use my experience to design and propose a solution that meets your needs, and help you drive it forward.
Depending on your case, your budget, and level of investment, it can range from a day of work to months of work.

<article class="callout warning">

When proposing new web technologies, it is important to manage expectations.
Working with someone that has experience in the web standards process (_\*gently gestures at self\*_) can significantly increase the odds of success,
but there are no guarantees.
That said, I will advise you on odds of success upfront,
and if implementation feasibility comes up as an issue, that happens very early in the process so I will help you make an informed decision on whether to invest further.
</article>

This type of work is essentially a public service, which can be a **great PR opportunity**, and I can help you frame it appropriately in your public communications.
For the same reason, I charge a reduced hourly rate for this type of work, as I consider it an investment in the web platform and the community.

### Demystifying the web standards process

Additionally, many companies whose livelihood depends on the web platform in some way want to get involved in web standards,
but **the process seems opaque and intimidating**.
I can help you navigate it and train your team on how to get involved in the future.
Through a series of sessions, I can demystify the process with a bias towards action:
explain how web standards work, what makes a proposal effective and increases its odds of success, how to get involved,
and how to evaluate tradeoffs for your involvement to ensure you get the most bang for your buck.

Understanding how the standards process works and what drives implementations is not only valuable for proposing new features,
but also for evaluating the current state of the web platform and strategic planning.
I will teach you how to tell the difference between web platform features that are _just about_ to become [Baseline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) and those that are years away.

### Co-designing the web platform

If you are interested in both of the above, this is the perfect combination.
After the demystification sessions, we can work on designing new web platform features that address your team’s pain points and writing up proposals for them **together**,
which can serve as an excellent hands-on case study
so your team can get first-hand practical experience with how the web sausage is made.

### "Aren’t web standards only for MAANGs that can play the long game?"

When looking at web standards timelines from the outside, it often seems like the process is slow.
However, in most cases, work stalls because no-one is driving it forward, not because of inherent resistance or dysfunction.

There are many success stories of **major** web technologies going from conception to [baseline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) in less than two years (e.g. [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers)),
and smaller features in a matter of months.
This is shorter than many product development cycles!

Additionally, web standards work delivers a lot of short-term value too:
- **Progressive enhancement**: Many web features can add value even before they are implemented in all browsers, through polyfills and/or progressive enhancement.
- **Strategy**: Knowing what the web platform landscape will look like in the near-future can help you make better product decisions today, and give you a leg up over competitors.
- **PR**: This type of work is a public service, which can be a great PR opportunity.


<!-- <article class="whyme note">

I have a track record of designing, reviewing, and getting web technologies shipped in browsers for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years. I have not only [designed web technologies](/specs) that got accepted, but pushed them to implementation across browsers, often in the face of strong initial opposition.

As a longtime [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member, I [co-edit several W3C specifications](/publications/#specifications), and have [designed web technologies](/specs) that have shipped in every browser and are used by millions of developers.

I have also been an elected [W3C TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) member for 4 years, reviewing web technologies across the entire stack for usability and architectural consistency, giving me unique insight into the process.

## Usability Research & Product Consulting

I have deep experience in product and API design, and specialize in:
- **Creative products**, especially those that facilitate web design and development, either for professional web developers and designers, as well as products democratizing it and making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **API Design**, especially for the Web

With my unique combination of usability/product and deep software engineering expertise,
I can help you design user interfaces and/or APIs that users love, while using my deep technical expertise to
prioritize directions that maximize Impact/Effort.

My involvement can range from async design reviews / audits, to mentorship sessions with your team, and even hands-on research work.

### What is a design review? { #design-reviews }

Broadly speaking, a [design review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) is a structured process where an expert evaluates a product or API against usability principles and best practices, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement.
The deliverable is a report that outlines the findings, including specific usability issues, potential solutions, and recommendations for improvement.

A good design review can uncover several usability issues, **saving your company hours of user testing and development time**.
It can also be completed much faster than user testing (typically 1-3 weeks), as it does not require recruiting participants, scheduling sessions, and analyzing results.
It is not a substitute for user testing, but rather a way to make the most of it, by getting a good chunk of usability issues out of the way before that stage.

Design reviews can be conducted at all stages in the design cycle, provided that there is a prototype with sufficient detail.
Since they are based on inspection, as opposed to actual use by a real user, they can be used to evaluate much more abstract or scoped down versions of a user interface that would be hard or impossible to test with participants, e.g. a set of specifications, an isolated segment of a design, such as a single dialog box, or a [microinteraction](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/).

### What about APIs?

[API Design is UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY),
but doing user research of these types of UIs does require a very specific type of expertise.
In addition to design reviews, interviews, or surveys,
I am one of the few usability researchers that have run user studies where the UI being tested was purely textual (e.g. a programming language or API),
and I can help you do the same.

<!--
## Product & API design

I have deep experience in product and [API design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY), and I can help you design user interfaces and/or APIs that users love and maximize Impact/Effort.
I can add value at any stage of the process, from researching user needs to brainstorming solutions or by authoring [design reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) of existing solutions.

A good [design review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) can uncover several usability issues, **saving your company hours of user testing and development time**.
It is not a substitute for user testing, but rather a way to make the most of it, by getting a good chunk of usability issues out of the way before that stage.

The scope of a design review can vary from **individual features to audits of entire products**.
Design reviews can take varying amounts of time, from **a day to several weeks**.
We can discuss the scope, goals, and budget together.
Designing good solutions that balance tradeoffs well takes a lot longer, so shorter design reviews focus more on identifying issues, while longer ones also include potential solutions that balance tradeoffs well and maximize Impact/Effort.

<article class="whyme note">

I hold a PhD in usability ([Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)) from [MIT](https://mit.edu), and have taught usability to MIT students for years.
Additionally, I have launched dozens of software artifacts, which often succeeded against competition mainly on the basis of superior UX/DX.

My software engineering expertise combined with my usability and product design background give me a unique ability to design solutions that balance user needs and implementation effort.

**It is important to me that my work adds value.**
While I’m open to reviewing any software artifact, I tend to be a better fit when the product is related to design or development.
If I determine early on in the process that I’m not a good fit for reviewing your product, I will let you know and refund your deposit. This is very rare.

## Solutions to hard CSS problems

Your engineers have tried everything they can think of, but they can’t find a solution to a certain CSS problem that is sufficiently flexible?
This can be particularly true for products that ship CSS to their customers, so flexibility becomes a requirement, not just a nice-to-have.
This is my bread and butter!

You will communicate your requirements and constraints to me, and I will come up with a solution that meets as many of them as possible.
If I cannot meet all of them, I will explain the tradeoffs and help you decide.
I will also provide a detailed explanation of how the solution works, so that your engineers can understand it and maintain it in the future.
These tend to be shorter engagements, usually a few hours to a few days.

<article class="whyme note">

I have literally written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20) on this exact topic: **better solutions to hard CSS problems**.
It was a smashing success, it got translated into 8 languages and dubbed ["Best CSS book" by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/consumer-reviews/sns-bestreviews-electronics-the-best-css-book-20200701-kda2pyikobda5o3c4ivi4wzfui-story.html).

As a [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years, I could not be closer to the metal.
I am aware of CSS technologies that other developers have not yet caught up to,
or details about how CSS works that I can leverage to create better solutions.

## Developer-focused Research

It is widely known that poor user experience directly translates to lost revenue.
However, improving UX on a product that targets web developers and designers is a unique challenge,
as it requires both usability and domain expertise, and very few UX researchers have both.
It’s also a myth that UX research is only for visual UIs: you can absolutely do usability studies for syntax, and I have done it many times.
It’s also a myth that usability testing is a big undertaking: low-fi usability testing can be done in a few hours,
and even [as few as five users uncover > 80% of usability issues](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).

I can help you design and run surveys, interviews, and user studies to improve developer experience,
distill the findings into actionable insights, and design and implement changes needed to improve it.
I can also train your team on how to do this themselves in the future.

<article class="whyme note">

I have a unique combination of skills that make me a great fit for this kind of work:
a solid connection to web designers & developers fostered over {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of developer advocacy,
personal experience as a web developer and designer,
a solid foundation of scientific research and data analysis from my MIT PhD days,
and a decade of experience running user studies for technical products.

I have run user studies for scientific research at MIT, and for developer research, some of which was funded by Google.
I have also been sponsored by **Google** to help design major web development surveys, such as [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com) and the inaugural [State of HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/) (which also resulted in [novel survey UI](/blog/2024/context-chips/)), both taken by tens of thousands of developers every year and breaking participation records for the years I was involved.

I have also led [research efforts into web development practices via scraping](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/css), which is another avenue we can explore.

## Web Architecture Consulting

Looking to build a new web product or modernize existing infrastructure?
Maybe you have performance or maintenance challenges with your current approach.
Or maybe you want a sanity check that you’re making the right architectural decisions.
Perhaps you aren't sure how to leverage modern web standards to achieve the best outcomes for your business and customers.
Though a series of 2 - 4 hour sessions, I'll meet with your technical leaders to work through key architecture decisions that will help you achieve your goals by leveraging the best of the modern Web.

## Web Components

I can help audit your web component APIs for usability and consistency, or even hands-on architect new web components you need.

<article class="whyme note">
I am very active in the web components community and at the forefront of web platform API development for web components.
I was a founding member of the Web Components Community Group.
I have worked at Font Awesome as Product Lead, with a focus on Web Awesome, its web component focused UI toolkit.
</article>

## Training & Education

I’m open to doing training and on-site workshops on topics related to web technologies, usability, API design, and general software product design principles.
These can be tailored to your team’s needs, and can be either hands-on or higher level.

<article class="whyme note">

I have a track record of {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of teaching web technologies and usability to various audiences, from professionals to MIT students.

I have travelled the world [giving over 100 invited talks at web conferences in 4 continents](http://lea.verou.me/speaking), written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20), [co-designed and co-taught an MIT course](https://designftw.mit.edu) on usability and web technologies which became a permanent subject, and written several [articles](https://lea.verou.me/publications/#articles) in well-known industry publications.

## Hands-on Product Development

While **we do not typically undertake freelance web design & development or graphic design projects** (e.g. _“I need a website for my business”_),
there are a few cases where I’m open to doing hands-on implementation work, especially in conjunction with other types of consulting.
Some examples of such projects include developing…
- Prototypes and proofs-of-concept
- Polyfills
- Web components
- Flexible, maintainable CSS solutions to specific problems
- Adding a new feature to any of my open source projects
- Web Platform Tests
- Tooling to facilitate all of the above

## What else?

If it sounds like I might be the perfect person to help, but you’re not quite sure how,
or your project doesn’t fit any of the categories above, don’t hesitate to <a class="contact">reach out</a>.
I love unusual, challenging projects and am very comfortable with ambiguity.

As an example, a consulting project I remember very fondly, was when [O’Reilly Media](https://oreilly.com) (one of the biggest tech publishers)
asked me to design a print book layout in HTML and CSS which they used as a sample of what can be achieved with such a pipeline.
Nothing like this had been done with CSS before, and I _loved_ exploring (and pushing) the boundaries of what is possible.
