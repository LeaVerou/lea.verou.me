I have limited time for consulting, and thus am very selective about which projects I accept.
I prefer to take on challenging and/or impactful projects that are particularly relevant to my interests and areas of expertise, and where I feel I can add the most value.

I’m very open to unusual projects, and I love working with companies across the spectrum of size and maturity.
Email me at `lea＠verou.me` ([don’t copy/paste it](/blog/2009/11/yet-another-email-hiding-technique/)) and we can discuss.
Some ideas from past projects are below.

## Usability-focused design reviews


A good [design review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) can uncover several usability issues, **saving your company hours of user testing and development time**.
Design reviews are not a substitute for user testing, but rather a way to make the most of it, by getting the low-hanging usability issues out of the way first.
These could be either for entire products or individual features.

Design reviews can take varying amounts of time, from **a day to several weeks**.
We can discuss the scope, goals, and budget together.
Designing good solutions that balance tradeoffs well takes a lot longer, so shorter design reviews focus more on identifying issues, while longer ones also include potential solutions that balance tradeoffs well.

Design reviews **do not need to be limited to products with graphical interfaces**.
In fact, a lot of my expertise lies in [API design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY).


<article class="note" style="--label: 'Why me?'">

I hold a PhD in usability from MIT, and have taught the subject to MIT students for years.
Additionally, I have launched dozens of software artifacts, which often succeeded against competition mainly on the basis of superior UX/DX.
My deep expertise in software engineering in addition to usability and product design means I have a unique ability to design solutions that balance user needs and implementation effort.

I tend to be a better fit when the product is related to web design or development, but I’m open to reviewing any software artifact.
It is important to me that my work adds value.
If I determine early on in the process that I’m not a good fit for reviewing your product, I will let you know and refund you the deposit. This is rare, and has only happened once so far.

## Web Standards

Struggling to work around certain [web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform) limitations?
Have you considered fixing the core problem instead?
It was previously thought that web standards are only for large companies like Google that can afford to play the long game.
However, in recent years, there have been many success stories of major web technologies going from conception to baseline in two years (e.g. [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers)), and smaller features in a few months, a timespan that is shorter than many product cycles.

Together, we can scope down your pain points to a set of concrete proposals that can be implemented in a reasonable time frame and advise you on their odds of success.
If you want to invest in implementation in browsers, I can guide you through the available options and facilitate the process.
As an added bonus, since this benefits everyone working with web technologies, I can help you make the most of your investment by framing it appropriately to the public.

<article class="note" style="--label: 'Why me?'">

I have a track record of designing, reviewing, and getting web technologies shipped for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years. I have not only [designed web technologies](/specs) that got accepted, but pushed them to implementation across browsers, often in the face of strong initial opposition.

As a [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years, I [co-edit several W3C specifications](/publications/#specifications), and have [designed web technologies](/specs) that have shipped in every browser and are used by millions of developers.

I have also been an elected [W3C TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) member for 4 years, reviewing web technologies across the entire stack for usability and architectural consistency, giving me unique insight into the process.

## Solutions to hard CSS problems

Your engineers have tried everything they can think of, but they can’t find a solution to a certain CSS problem that is sufficiently flexible?
This can be particularly true for products that ship CSS to their customers, so flexibility becomes a requirement, not just a nice-to-have.
This is my bread and butter!

You will communicate your requirements and constraints to me, and I will come up with a solution that meets them.
I will also provide a detailed explanation of how the solution works, so that your engineers can understand it and maintain it in the future.
These tend to be shorter engagements, usually a few hours to a few days.

<article class="note" style="--label: 'Why me?'">

I have literally written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20) on this exact topic: **better solutions to hard CSS problems**.
It was a smashing success, it got translated into 8 languages and dubbed ["Best CSS book" by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/consumer-reviews/sns-bestreviews-electronics-the-best-css-book-20200701-kda2pyikobda5o3c4ivi4wzfui-story.html).

As a [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years, I could not be closer to the metal. I have a track record of  {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years of designing and reviewing web technologies.

## Surveys and other web developer research

Want to explore developer needs and pain points, as part of your market research?
I’m happy to help you design and run surveys, interviews, and other research methods to get the data you need.
I can also help you analyze the data and draw conclusions.

<article class="note" style="--label: 'Why me?'">

I have a unique combination of skills that make me a great fit for this kind of work:
a solid connection to web designers & developers through the rest of my work,
and the foundation of scientific research and data analysis from my PhD at MIT.

I have been sponsored by Google to design major web development surveys, such as [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com) and the inaugural [State of HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/) (which also resulted in [novel survey UI](/blog/2024/context-chips/)), both taken by tens of thousands of developers every year.

## Training & Education

I’m open to doing training and on-site workshops on topics related to web technologies, usability, API design, and general software product design.
These can be tailored to your team’s needs, and can be either hands-on or more high level.

<article class="note" style="--label: 'Why me?'">

I have a track record of {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of teaching web technologies and usability to various audiences, from web design & development professionals to MIT students.

I have travelled the world, [given over 100 invited talks at web conferences in 4 continents](http://lea.verou.me/speaking), written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20), [co-designed and co-taught an MIT course](https://designftw.mit.edu) which on usability and web technologies which became a permanent subject, and wrote several [articles](https://lea.verou.me/publications/#articles) in various well-known industry publications.
