<style>.whyme { --label: 'Why me?' }</style>

I have limited time for consulting, and thus am very selective about which projects I accept.
I prefer to take on projects where I can add the most value, i.e. challenging and/or impactful projects that are relevant to my interests and areas of expertise.

I work with companies across the spectrum of size and maturity, from MAANGs to tiny startups doing cool work.
Some areas I frequently consult on are described below, but I’m very open to unusual projects, so don’t be discouraged if your project doesn’t fit neatly into one of these categories.
Just <a class="contact">drop me an email</a> and we can discuss.

On a high level, my areas of expertise span **product**, **usability**, and **web architecture**.
This includes:
- Web standards and web platform design, especially CSS
- Product design, strategy, and vision for products targeting web developers and designers
- API design for the Web
- Open source software and open standards
- Color science, especially as it relates to web technologies
- Web Components
- Design systems and design tokens, especially around their use for Web UIs
- Qualitative and quantitative research methods

My involvement can take many forms, depending on what fits your needs and budget.
For example:
- Short, one-off mentorship sessions to help you or your team with a specific problem
- Design reviews and audits of products or APIs (existing or 0→1)
- Short- or medium-term research projects to explore a specific problem or investigate designer/developer needs in a specific area
- Design web standards solutions for a specific problem, drive developer interest and implementation across browsers
- Coaching
- On-site or remote sessions or workshops tailored to your team’s needs
- Fractional positions (technical fellow, product manager, etc) when you need expertise on an ongoing basis but don’t need a full-time hire

These are only examples, and I’m very open to discussing other ways my expertise can add value and help you out.

Rates do vary by scope, project type, and length, and I do offer a sliding scale for nonprofit organizations, projects with strong social impact, and organizations in low-income countries.
Please <a class="contact">reach out</a> for more details, and to discuss what’s feasible for your budget.

## Product & API design

I have deep experience in product and [API design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY), and I can help you design user interfaces and/or APIs that users love and maximize Impact/Effort.
I can add value at any stage of the process, from researching user needs to brainstorming solutions or by authoring [design reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) of existing solutions.

A good [design review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) can uncover several usability issues, **saving your company hours of user testing and development time**.
It is not a substitute for user testing, but rather a way to make the most of it, by getting a good chunk of usability issues out of the way before that stage.

The scope of a design review can vary from **individual features to audits of entire products**.
Design reviews can take varying amounts of time, from **a day to several weeks**.
We can discuss the scope, goals, and budget together.
Designing good solutions that balance tradeoffs well takes a lot longer, so shorter design reviews focus more on identifying issues, while longer ones also include potential solutions that balance tradeoffs well and maximize Impact/Effort.

<article class="whyme note">

I hold a PhD in usability ([Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)) from [MIT](https://mit.edu), and have taught usability to MIT students for years.
Additionally, I have launched dozens of software artifacts, which often succeeded against competition mainly on the basis of superior UX/DX.

My software engineering expertise combined with my usability and product design background give me a unique ability to design solutions that balance user needs and implementation effort.

**It is important to me that my work adds value.**
While I’m open to reviewing any software artifact, I tend to be a better fit when the product is related to design or development.
If I determine early on in the process that I’m not a good fit for reviewing your product, I will let you know and refund your deposit. This is very rare.

## Web Standards

Struggling to work around certain [web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform) limitations?
Have you considered fixing the core problem instead?
Or maybe there is already a feature that does what you need, but is not yet implemented across all browsers and you want to help move it along faster.

Many companies want to get involved in web standards, but the process seems opaque and intimidating.
I can help you navigate it; together, we can scope down your pain points to a set of concrete proposals that can be implemented in a reasonable time frame and advise you on their odds of success depending on your budget.
I can also train your team on how it all works and how to get involved,
so that they can contribute themselves in the future.

If you want to invest in implementation across browsers, I can guide you through the available options and facilitate the process.
As an added bonus, since this benefits everyone working with web technologies,
I can help you make the most of your investment by framing it appropriately to the public.

It was previously thought that web standards work is only for large companies like Google that can afford to play the long game.
However, in recent years, there have been many success stories of major web technologies going from conception to baseline in less than two years,
and smaller features in a matter of months, a timespan that is shorter than many product development cycles.

<article class="whyme note">

I have a track record of designing, reviewing, and getting web technologies shipped in browsers for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years. I have not only [designed web technologies](/specs) that got accepted, but pushed them to implementation across browsers, often in the face of strong initial opposition.

As a longtime [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member, I [co-edit several W3C specifications](/publications/#specifications), and have [designed web technologies](/specs) that have shipped in every browser and are used by millions of developers.

I have also been an elected [W3C TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) member for 4 years, reviewing web technologies across the entire stack for usability and architectural consistency, giving me unique insight into the process.

## Solutions to hard CSS problems

Your engineers have tried everything they can think of, but they can’t find a solution to a certain CSS problem that is sufficiently flexible?
This can be particularly true for products that ship CSS to their customers, so flexibility becomes a requirement, not just a nice-to-have.
This is my bread and butter!

You will communicate your requirements and constraints to me, and I will come up with a solution that meets as many of them as possible.
If I cannot meet all of them, I will explain the tradeoffs and help you decide.
I will also provide a detailed explanation of how the solution works, so that your engineers can understand it and maintain it in the future.
These tend to be shorter engagements, usually a few hours to a few days.

<article class="whyme note">

I have literally written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20) on this exact topic: **better solutions to hard CSS problems**.
It was a smashing success, it got translated into 8 languages and dubbed ["Best CSS book" by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/consumer-reviews/sns-bestreviews-electronics-the-best-css-book-20200701-kda2pyikobda5o3c4ivi4wzfui-story.html).

As a [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) member for {{ currentYear - 2012 }} years, I could not be closer to the metal.
I am aware of CSS technologies that other developers have not yet caught up to,
or details about how CSS works that I can leverage to create better solutions.

## Developer-focused Research

It is widely known that poor user experience directly translates to lost revenue.
However, improving UX on a product that targets web developers and designers is a unique challenge,
as it requires both usability and domain expertise, and very few UX researchers have both.
It’s also a myth that UX research is only for visual UIs: you can absolutely do usability studies for syntax, and I have done it many times.
It’s also a myth that usability testing is a big undertaking: low-fi usability testing can be done in a few hours,
and even [as few as five users uncover > 80% of usability issues](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).

I can help you design and run surveys, interviews, and user studies to improve developer experience,
distill the findings into actionable insights, and design and implement changes needed to improve it.
I can also train your team on how to do this themselves in the future.

<article class="whyme note">

I have a unique combination of skills that make me a great fit for this kind of work:
a solid connection to web designers & developers fostered over {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of developer advocacy,
personal experience as a web developer and designer,
a solid foundation of scientific research and data analysis from my MIT PhD days,
and a decade of experience running user studies for technical products.

I have run user studies for scientific research at MIT, and for developer research, some of which was funded by Google.
I have also been sponsored by **Google** to help design major web development surveys, such as [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com) and the inaugural [State of HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/) (which also resulted in [novel survey UI](/blog/2024/context-chips/)), both taken by tens of thousands of developers every year and breaking participation records for the years I was involved.

I have also led [research efforts into web development practices via scraping](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/css), which is another avenue we can explore.

## Web Architecture Consulting

Looking to build a new web product or modernize existing infrastructure?
Maybe you have performance or maintenance challenges with your current approach.
Or maybe you want a sanity check that you’re making the right architectural decisions.
Perhaps you aren't sure how to leverage modern web standards to achieve the best outcomes for your business and customers.
Though a series of 2 - 4 hour sessions, I'll meet with your technical leaders to work through key architecture decisions that will help you achieve your goals by leveraging the best of the modern Web.

## Web Components

I can help audit your web component APIs for usability and consistency, or even hands-on architect new web components you need.

<article class="whyme note">
I am very active in the web components community and at the forefront of web platform API development for web components.
I was a founding member of the Web Components Community Group.
I have worked at Font Awesome as Product Lead, with a focus on Web Awesome, its web component focused UI toolkit.
</article>

## Training & Education

I’m open to doing training and on-site workshops on topics related to web technologies, usability, API design, and general software product design principles.
These can be tailored to your team’s needs, and can be either hands-on or higher level.

<article class="whyme note">

I have a track record of {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of teaching web technologies and usability to various audiences, from professionals to MIT students.

I have travelled the world [giving over 100 invited talks at web conferences in 4 continents](http://lea.verou.me/speaking), written a [bestselling CSS book](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20), [co-designed and co-taught an MIT course](https://designftw.mit.edu) on usability and web technologies which became a permanent subject, and written several [articles](https://lea.verou.me/publications/#articles) in well-known industry publications.

## What else?

If your project doesn't fit any of these categories, but it sounds like I might be the perfect person to help, don’t hesitate to reach out.
I’m very open to unusual, challenging projects and am very comfortable with ambiguity.

As an example, one of my most unusual consulting projects was designing a (print) book layout in HTML and CSS for [O’Reilly Media](https://oreilly.com) (one of the biggest tech publishers) back in 2015,
which they used as a sample of what can be achieved with such a pipeline.

**I do not typically undertake freelance web design & development or graphic design projects** (e.g. _“I need a website for my business”_), but I may make exceptions for projects that are particularly interesting or relevant to my work.

Rates do vary by scope, project type, and length, and I do offer a sliding scale for nonprofit organizations, projects with strong social impact, and organizations in low-income countries.
Please reach out to discuss what’s feasible for your budget.
