## How can I help?

Given limited availability, I prioritize consulting projects where I can have the greatest impact — typically those that are both challenging and aligned with my expertise.

On a high level, my areas of expertise are:
- [**Product** & **Usability**](/consulting/usability)
- [**Web architecture** & **Web platform design**](/consulting/webplatform)
- [**Developer research / DevRel**](/consulting/devrel).

You can read more about each of these areas in the corresponding pages.

My involvement can take many forms, depending on what fits your needs and budget.
For example:
- Short, [one-off mentorship sessions](#one-hour-session)
- [Design reviews](#design-reviews) and audits of products or APIs (existing or 0→1)
- Short- or medium-term research projects to explore a specific problem, investigate user needs in a specific area, or drive web standards forwards through developer evangelism
- Coaching sessions
- Joining your company Slack for async help
- On-site or remote sessions or workshops tailored to your team’s needs
- Talks and articles (for conferences, magazines, etc.)
- Fractional positions (technical fellow, product manager, etc) when you need expertise on an ongoing basis but not a full-time hire

These are only examples, and I’m very open to discussing other ways my expertise can add value and help you out.
Unusual projects are often the most interesting.
Just <a class="contact">drop me an email</a> and we can discuss.

Rates do vary by scope, project type, and length, and I do offer a sliding scale for nonprofit organizations, or organizations in low-income countries, and projects with strong social impact or that provide public benefit.
Please <a class="contact">reach out</a> for more details, and to discuss what’s feasible for your budget.

## 1 Hour Mentorship Session { #one-hour-session }

If you have a specific problem you need help with, I can help you out in a one-off mentorship session.
You pay **$500**, get one hour of my time and you can use it as you see fit.
We can brainstorm solutions to a specific problem, you can ask me about web standards or a CSS feature you struggle with,
or anything else you want to discuss that is relevant to my experience and/or areas of expertise.
You can bring only yourself, or your entire team.
There are no guarantees or deliverables.

**I’m currently gauging interest in these sessions.**
Please enter your email below to be notified when they become available:

<form netlify name="mentorship" style="display: flex; gap: .3em" netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="foo@bar.com" required>
  <label hidden>Don’t fill this out if you’re human: <input name="bot-field" /></label>
  <button type="submit">Notify me</button>
</form>


## What else?

If it sounds like I might be the perfect person to help, but you’re not quite sure how,
or your project doesn’t fit any of the categories above, don’t hesitate to <a class="contact">reach out</a>.
I love unusual, challenging projects and am very comfortable with ambiguity.

As an example, a consulting project I remember very fondly, was when [O’Reilly Media](https://oreilly.com) (one of the biggest tech publishers)
asked me to design a print book layout in HTML and CSS which they used as a sample of what can be achieved with such a pipeline.
Nothing like this had been done with CSS before, and I _loved_ exploring (and pushing) the boundaries of what is possible.
