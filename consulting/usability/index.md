I have deep experience in product and API design, and specialize in:
- **Creative products**, especially those that facilitate web design and development, either for professional web developers and designers, as well as products democratizing it and making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **API Design**, especially for the Web

With my unique combination of usability/product and deep software engineering expertise,
I can help you design user interfaces and/or APIs that users love, while using my deep technical expertise to
prioritize directions that maximize Impact/Effort.

My involvement can range from async design reviews / audits, to mentorship sessions with your team, and even hands-on research work.

## Why me?

My software engineering expertise combined with my usability and product design background give me a unique ability to design solutions that balance user needs and implementation effort.

- I have launched [dozens of software artifacts for developers](/projects/), which often succeeded against competition mainly on the basis of superior UX/DX.
- I have designed [numerous web platform features](/specs/) that have shipped in every browser and are used by millions of developers.
- I have performed or assisted in over 100 design reviews of new web platform features during my tenure as a [W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) member. I was elected in the W3C TAG on the basis of my usability and API design expertise.
- I have worked as **Product Lead** at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), the company behind the world’s most popular icon toolkit, used in one third of all websites in the world.
- I hold a **PhD** in Usability ([Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction)) & Innovation from [MIT](https://mit.edu)
- I have taught usability to MIT students for years through a novel course I co-designed and co-taught with [David Karger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Karger), combining my two passions: usability and web technologies.
- I have published [peer-reviewed research](/publications/#research) in top-tier academic venues in the field of usability and API design.

You can read the following essays and case studies I have written to understand my philosophy around product design:

## Design Reviews { #design-reviews }

Broadly speaking, a [design review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_review) is a structured process where an expert evaluates a product or API against usability principles and best practices, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement.
The deliverable is a report that outlines the findings, including specific usability issues, potential solutions, and recommendations for improvement.

A good design review can uncover several usability issues, **saving your company hours of user testing and development time**.
It can also be completed much faster than user testing (typically 1-3 weeks), as it does not require recruiting participants, scheduling sessions, and analyzing results.
It is not a substitute for user testing, but rather a way to make the most of it, by getting a good chunk of usability issues out of the way before that stage.

Design reviews can be conducted at all stages in the design cycle, provided that there is a prototype with sufficient detail.
Since they are based on inspection, as opposed to actual use by a real user, they can be used to evaluate much more abstract or scoped down versions of a user interface that would be hard or impossible to test with participants, e.g. a set of specifications, an isolated segment of a design, such as a single dialog box, or a [microinteraction](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/).

You can read more about design reviews in this excellent overview by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-expert-reviews/).
While there are many UX firms that do design reviews (NNGroup above being an excellent example),
when it comes to domain-specific products (such as design or development tools), for a good design review you need both deep usability expertise and the domain expertise to understand the product and its users.
That’s where I come in.

## API Design

[API Design is UI Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92XUzc1OHY),
but doing user research of these types of UIs does require a very specific type of expertise.
In addition to design reviews, interviews, or surveys,
I am one of the few usability researchers that have run user studies where the UI being tested was purely textual (e.g. a programming language or API),
and I can help you do the same.
