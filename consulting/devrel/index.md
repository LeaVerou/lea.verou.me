## Why me?

I have a unique combination of skills that make me a great fit for this kind of work:
a solid connection to web designers & developers fostered over {{ currentYear - 2009 }} years of developer advocacy,
and personal experience as a web developer and designer.

- I have been funded by Google to run several major web development surveys, such as [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com) and the inaugural [State of HTML](https://stateofhtml.com/) (which also resulted in [novel survey UI](/blog/2024/context-chips/)), both taken by tens of thousands of developers every year and breaking participation records for the years I was involved.
- I have led [research efforts into web development practices via scraping](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/css).
- I have given over [100 conference talks](/speaking) on web development topics
- I have written a [bestselling CSS book](https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20) that was translated into 8 languages and dubbed ["Best CSS book" by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/consumer-reviews/sns-bestreviews-electronics-the-best-css-book-20200701-kda2pyikobda5o3c4ivi4wzfui-story.html).
- I have worked at W3C as a **Developer Advocate**, their first ever devrel hire.

## Developer-focused Research

It is widely known that poor user experience directly translates to lost revenue.
However, improving UX on a product that targets web developers and designers is a unique challenge,
as it requires both usability and domain expertise, and very few UX researchers have both.
It’s also a myth that UX research is only for visual UIs: you can absolutely do usability studies for syntax, and I have done it many times.
It’s also a myth that usability testing is a big undertaking: low-fi usability testing can be done in a few hours,
and even [as few as five users uncover > 80% of usability issues](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).

I can help you design and run surveys, interviews, and user studies to improve developer experience,
distill the findings into actionable insights, and design and implement changes needed to improve it.
I can also train your team on how to do this themselves in the future.

## Creating dev tools

While **we do not typically undertake freelance web design & development or graphic design projects** (e.g. _“I need a website for my business”_),
there are a few cases where we’re open to doing hands-on implementation work, especially in conjunction with other types of consulting.
Some examples of such projects include developing…
- Prototypes and proofs-of-concept
- Polyfills
- Web components
- Flexible, maintainable CSS solutions to specific problems
- Adding a new feature to any of my open source projects
- Web Platform Tests
- Tooling to facilitate all of the above


## Solutions to hard CSS problems

Your engineers have tried everything they can think of, but they can’t find a solution to a certain CSS problem that is sufficiently flexible?
This can be particularly true for products that ship CSS to their customers, so flexibility becomes a requirement, not just a nice-to-have.
This is my bread and butter!

You will communicate your requirements and constraints to me, and I will come up with a solution that meets as many of them as possible.
If I cannot meet all of them, I will explain the tradeoffs and help you decide.
I will also provide a detailed explanation of how the solution works, so that your engineers can understand it and maintain it in the future.
These tend to be shorter engagements, usually a few hours to a few days.
