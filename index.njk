**Hi, I’m Lea!** 👋🏼
I make things that help people make things.
Ι [design web technologies](/specs/) implemented in your browser,
launch [open source dev tools](/projects/) used by millions,
and [consult](/consulting/) on my areas of expertise.
I hold a PhD in usability & innovation from [MIT](https://mit.edu)&thinsp;—&thinsp;but chose product over research.
I love sharing knowledge and [speak](/speaking/), [teach](https://designftw.mit.edu), [write](/publications/),
and [blog](/blog/) about product design, web technologies, usability, and their intersection.
