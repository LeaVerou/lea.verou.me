**Hi, I’m Lea!** 👋🏼
I make things for making things.
I’m an [award-winning](https://openjsf.org/blog/javascriptlandia-awards-2025#:~:text=Lea%20Verou) web standards leader,
and have designed [several web technologies](/specs/) implemented in your browser.
I have launched [open source dev tools](/projects/) used by millions,
and [consult](/consulting/) on my areas of expertise.
I hold a PhD in usability & innovation from [MIT](https://mit.edu)&thinsp;—&thinsp;but chose product over research.
