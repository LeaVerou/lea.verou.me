I recently stumbled across [The Oatmeal‚Äôs series on Creativity](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_things).
While all of it is spot on, the part on [erasers](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_erasers) hit especially hard.

It was exactly what I needed to hear.
You see, only a few days prior, **Font Awesome and I had parted ways** ‚Äî the end of a short, but transformative chapter.
I‚Äôm proud of what we built together, and grateful for what I learned along the way.
But it was time to move on.

Jobs are a lot like relationships.
They often start with infatuation ‚Äî and end with the realization that you‚Äôre simply not compatible, and that‚Äôs no-one‚Äôs fault.
Letting go always stings, even when it‚Äôs the right call.
There‚Äôs always grief: when you‚Äôre not ready to move on, you grieve the bond; when you are, you grieve your expectations.
But every ending leaves behind clarity ‚Äî about who you are, and what makes you happy.

## The pursuit of happiness

Today is my 39th birthday ‚Äî and this summer marks 20 years since I first dipped my toes into this industry.
Naturally, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reflection.
<!-- more -->

As is typical for ADHDers, I have done a ton of different things, and built a diverse skillset as a result.
But what made me happiest?
The list went a bit like this:
- **Entrepreneurship:** Co-founding a startup and driving it to become a household name (in Greece ‚Äî this was 2008!)
- **Consulting:** Being a full-time consultant, speaker, and author, traveling the world and jumping from one exciting gig to another
- **Academia:**[^academia] Pushing the boundaries of Human-Computer Interaction at MIT and teaching MIT CS students to care about people.

[^academia]: Many things wrong with academia, but the intellectual freedom is unparalleled, and it makes up for a lot.

All had three things in common: **autonomy**, **breadth**, and **impact**.

These three things have been the biggest predictors of happiness for me ‚Äî far more than **income** [^alanwatts] or **work-life balance**, which are the usual suspects.

[^alanwatts]: See also [Alan Watts‚Äô ‚ÄúWhat if money was no object?‚Äù](https://www.zenpencils.com/comic/98-alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object/) ‚Äî a classic, but still relevant.

I used to **aspire to work-life balance** in the same way I aspired to frequent exercise ‚Äî because it was good for me, not because it gave me joy.
Eventually I realized that what makes me happy isn‚Äôt working less, it‚Äôs loving what I do, and feeling it matters.
Working less cannot transform how your work makes you _feel_; it can only dampen the effects.
But dilution doesn‚Äôt turn misery into joy ‚Äî at best it just makes it tolerable.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, poor WLB _can absolutely_ make you miserable; when long hours are an externally imposed expectation,
not an internal drive fueled by passion.
As with many things in life, it‚Äôs _enthusiastic consent_ that makes all the difference.

Then there‚Äôs **breadth**.
Most jobs try to box you in:
PM or engineer? Scientist or practitioner? UX Researcher or designer? DevRel or standards?
And I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs silly that people are forced to choose, and present themselves as _less than_ to seem more attractive to hiring managers.
To use myself as an example:
* **Web architecture:** I have designed [several](/specs) web technologies that have shipped across all browsers.
I‚Äôve spent 4 years in the [TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group),
reviewing new web technologies across the web platform,
and eventually leading the [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/) effort.
* **Product/usability/HCI:** Prior to working as Product Lead at Font Awesome,
I‚Äôve earned a PhD at MIT in Human-Computer Interaction with a minor in Entrepreneurship & Innovation.
I published peer reviewed papers in top-tier HCI conferences,
and co-created/taught a [course](https://designftw.mit.edu) on usability & web technologies that is now a permanent subject.
I have run user research for scientific and industry projects.
I have started several open source projects, some used by millions.
In the more distant past, I co-founded a (then) well-known social startup in my home country, Greece and ran product, engineering, and design for three years (six if you count pre-incorporation).
* **DevRel:** I‚Äôve given over 100 conference talks, published a bestselling [book](https://amzn.to/3FXipvi) on CSS, and was the first devrel hire at W3C back in 2012.
I have built dozens of apps and polyfills that stimulated developer interest in new Web features and drove browser adoption.

Should I present myself as a web architecture expert, a usability/product person, an HCI researcher, or a Developer Advocate?

What a pointless dilemma if I ever saw one!

**Combining skills across different areas is a strength to be celebrated, not a weakness to be swept under the rug.**
The crossover between skills is where the magic happens.
Off the top of my head:
- Understanding usability principles has made me a *far* better web standards designer.
- **Web standards work is product design on hard mode.**
After the impossibly hard constraints and tradeoffs you deal with when designing APIs for the Web platform, regular product problems seem like a cakewalk (_we have versions? And we can actually change things?? And we have reliable metrics?!? And the stakeholders all work at the same company?!?_ ü§Ø).
- They often **feed into each other**: DevRel work made me a better communicator in everything I do.
Usability made me a better speaker and educator[^teachingui], so a better developer advocate too.
- Leading the [Web Platform Design Principles](https://w3.org/TR/design-principles) convinced me that **explicit design principles are immensely useful for all product work**.
- Web standards taught me that contrary to popular belief, **you do not need a benevolent dictator to ship**.
But then you do need a good process.
Consensus does not magically grow on trees, building consensus is its own [art](https://www.w3.org/guide/).

[^teachingui]: Teaching is absolutely a form of UI design ‚Äî a UI that exposes your knowledge to students ‚Äî the users.
There are many similarities between how good educators design their material and how good UI designers design interfaces.

Lastly, **impact** does not have to be about solving world hunger or curing cancer.
Making people‚Äôs lives a _little_ better is meaningful impact too.
It all boils down to:

$$\text{Impact} = \text{Individual Impact} \times \text{Reach}$$

You can achieve the same total impact by improving the lives of a few people a lot, or the lives of many people a little.
For example, [my work on web standards](/specs) has been some of the most fulfilling work I‚Äôve ever done.
Its _Individual Impact_ is small, but the _Reach_ is millions, since all front-end developers out there use the same web platform.

## What‚Äôs next?

Since consulting and entrepreneurship have been my happiness peaks, I figured I‚Äôd try them again.
Yes, both at once, because after all, we‚Äôve already established that WLB is a foreign concept ü§£

My apprentice [Dmitry](https://d12.me) and I have been in high gear building some exciting things,
which I hope to be able to share soon,
and I feel more exhilarated than I have in years.
I had missed drawing my own lines.

In parallel, I‚Äôm taking on select [consulting work](/consulting/),
so if you need help with certain challenges, or to level up your team around web architecture, CSS, or usability, [get in touch](/consulting/).

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not closing the door to full-time roles.
I know there are roles out there that value passion and offer the kind of autonomy, breadth, and impact that would let me thrive.
It‚Äôs the ROI of digging through rubble to find them that gives me pause ‚Äî as a product person at heart, I/E tradeoffs are top of mind.
But if you have such a unicorn, <a class="contact no-after" data-subject="ü¶Ñ job">I‚Äôm all ears</a>.

I also _finally_ took a few small steps to make my pro bono work financially sustainable, a long overdue todo item.
Both pages still need work, but you can now support my writing via [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/leaverou)[^dan], and my open source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/leaverou).
I made separate pages for my two most popular projects, [Prism](https://opencollective.com/prismjs) (nearing 1.8 **billion** total npm installs! ü§Ø) and [Color.js](https://opencollective.com/color).
This is as much about *prioritization* as it is about *sustainability*: **money is an excellent signal about what truly matters to people**.

<aside style="--label: 'PSA'">

It should go without saying that if you‚Äôre a for-profit company depending on open source work, you are _expected_ to fund it.
This is not a legal expectation, mainly because enforcement is a headache, but it absolutely is an ethical one.
It is also in your best interest ‚Äî funding the open source software you use ensures that it continues to be maintained.
**Don‚Äôt be the reason we can‚Äôt have nice things**.

[^dan]: Thanks [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) for the wording inspiration (with permission). These things are _so_ hard.

I don‚Äôt have a polished ‚Äúnext‚Äù to announce yet.<br>
But I‚Äôm exactly where I need to be.

**Sometimes the clearest lines are the ones drawn after you erase.**
