I recently stumbled across [The Oatmeal’s series on Creativity](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_things).
While all of it is spot on, the part on [erasers](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_erasers) hit especially hard.

It was exactly what I needed to hear.
You see, only a few days prior, **Font Awesome and I had parted ways** — the end of a short, but transformative chapter.
I’m proud of what we built together, and grateful for what I learned along the way.
But it was time to move on.

Jobs are a lot like relationships.
They often start with infatuation — and end with the realization that you’re simply not compatible.
Letting go stings, even when it’s the right call.
There’s always some grief: when you’re not ready to move on, you grieve the bond; when you are, you grieve your expectations.
But every ending leaves behind clarity — about who you are, and what makes you happy.

## The pursuit of happiness

As the 20th anniversary of my first job [^firstjob] approaches,
I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on the past twenty years.
In typical ADHD fashion, I have done a ton of different things, and built a diverse skillset as a result.
But what made me the happiest?
I realized that all the highs —
- Co-founding a startup and driving it to become a household name (in Greece)
- Being a full-time consultant, speaker, and author, traveling the world and jumping from one exciting gig to another
- Pushing the boundaries of Human-Computer Interaction at MIT and [teaching](https://designftw.mit.edu) MIT CS students to care about people
— had three things in common: **autonomy**, **breadth**, and **impact**.

Those three things have been the biggest predictors of happiness for me — far more than **income** [^alanwatts] or **work-life balance**, which are the usual suspects.

[^firstjob]: Believe it or not, I was more of a graphic designer than a developer back then.
Logos, posters, corporate identity, magazines, you name it, I’ve done it!

[^alanwatts]: See also [Alan Watts’ “What if money was no object?”](https://www.zenpencils.com/comic/98-alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object/) — a classic, but still relevant.

I used to aspire to **work-life balance** in the same way I aspired to frequent exercise — because it was good for me, not because it gave me joy.
Eventually I realized that what makes me happy isn’t working less, it’s loving what I do, and feeling it matters.
Working less cannot transform how your work makes you _feel_; it can only dampen it.
But dilution doesn’t turn misery into joy — at best it just makes it tolerable.
Sure, poor WLB _can_ make you miserable; when long hours are an expectation imposed from above,
not an internal drive fueled by passion.
As with many things in life, it’s _enthusiastic consent_ that makes all the difference.

Then there’s **breadth**.
Most jobs try to box you in:
PM or engineer? Scientist or practitioner? UX Researcher or designer? DevRel or standards?
And I’m like…

It’s silly that people are forced to choose, and present themselves as _less than_ to seem more employable.
To use myself as an example:
* **Web architecture:** I have designed [several](/specs) web technologies that have shipped across all browsers.
I’ve spent 4 years in the [TAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group),
reviewing new web technologies across the web platform,
and eventually leading the [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/) effort.
* **Product/usability:** Prior to working as Product Lead at Font Awesome,
I’ve earned a PhD at MIT in Human-Computer Interaction (with a minor in Entrepreneurship & Innovation),
where I published peer reviewed papers in top-tier HCI conferences,
and co-created/taught [a on usability and web technologies course](https://designftw.mit.edu) that is now a permanent subject.
I have run user research for several scientific and industry projects.
I have started several open source projects, some used all over the Web.
In the more distant past, I co-founded a (then) well-known social startup in my home country, Greece and ran product, engineering, and design for 3 years.
* **DevRel:** I’ve given over 100 conference talks, published a bestselling [book](https://amzn.to/3FXipvi) on CSS, and was the first devrel hire at W3 back in 2012.
I have built dozens of apps and polyfills that stimulated developer interest in new Web features and drove browser adoption.

Would I present myself as a web architecture expert, a usability/product person, or a devrel person?
What a pointless dilemma if I ever saw one!
**Combining skills across different areas is a strength to be celebrated, not a weakness to be swept under the rug.**
The crossover between skills is where the magic happens:
- Understanding usability principles has made me a *far* better web standards designer.
- **Web standards work is product design on hard mode.**
After the impossibly hard constraints and tradeoffs you deal with when designing APIs for the Web platform, regular product problems seem like a cakewalk (_we have versions? And we can actually change things?? And we have reliable metrics?!? And the stakeholders all work at the same company?!?_ 🤯).
- Devrel work has made me a better communicator in everything I do. Usability has made me a better speaker and educator, so better at devrel too.
- Working on the [Web Platform Design Principles](https://w3.org/TR/design-principles) has convinced me that **explicit design principles are immensely useful for all product work**.
- Web standards taught me that **contrary to popular belief, you do not need a benevolent dictator to ship**. But then you do need a good process. Consensus does not magically grow on trees, it’s an [art](https://www.w3.org/guide/).

Lastly, **impact** does not have to be about solving world hunger or curing cancer.
Making people’s lives a _little_ better is meaningful impact too.
If you like math, you could model total impact as:

$$\text{Impact} = \text{Individual Impact} \times \text{Reach}$$

You can achieve the same total impact by improving the lives of a few people a lot, or the lives of many people a little.
For example, [my work on web standards](/specs) has been some of the most fulfilling work I’ve ever done.
Its _Individual Impact_ is small, but the _Reach_ is millions, since all front-end developers out there have to use the same web platform.

## What’s next?

Since consulting and entrepreneurship have been my happiness peaks, I figured I’d try them again.
Yes, both at once, because after all, we’ve already established that WLB is a foreign concept 🤣

My apprentice [Dmitry](https://d12.me) and I have been in high gear building some exciting things,
which I hope to be able to share soon.
But I feel more exhilarated than I have in years.
I hadn’t realized how much I missed drawing my own lines.

In parallel, I’m taking on select [consulting work](/consulting/),
so if you need help or to level up your team around web architecture, CSS, or usability, [get in touch](/consulting/).

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not closing the door to full-time roles.
I know that roles that provide the kind of autonomy, breadth, and impact that would let me thrive _do_ exist.
Roles where my passion and energy would be celebrated.
It’s the ROI of digging through rubble to find them that I’m concerned about — and as a product person at heart, I/E tradeoffs are top of mind.
But if you think you have such a unicorn, <a class="contact no-after" data-subject="🦄 role">I’m all ears</a>.

I have also _finally_ taken a few small steps to make my pro bono work financially sustainable, a long overdue todo item.
You can now support my writing via [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/leaverou)[^dan], and my open source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/leaverou).
My most popular projects, [Prism](https://opencollective.com/prismjs) (nearing 1.8 **billion** total npm installs! 🤯) and [ColorJS](https://opencollective.com/color) have their own pages.
This is as much about *prioritization* as it is about *sustainability*: **money is an excellent signal about what truly matters to people**.

<aside style="--label: 'PSA'">

It should go without saying that if you’re a for-profit company depending on open source work, you are _expected_ to fund it.
This is not a legal expectation, mainly because enforcement is a headache, but it absolutely is an ethical one.
It is also in your best interest — funding the open source software you use ensures that it continues to be maintained.
**Don’t be the reason we can’t have nice things**.

[^dan]: Thanks [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) for the wording inspiration (with permission). These things are _so_ hard.

I don’t have a polished “next” to announce yet.<br>
But I’m exactly where I need to be.

**Sometimes the clearest lines are the ones drawn after you erase.**
