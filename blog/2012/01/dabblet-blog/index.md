Not sure if you noticed, but [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com) now has a blog: [blog.dabblet.com](http://blog.dabblet.com)

I’ll post there about Dabblet updates and not flood my regular subscribers here who may not care. So, if you are interested on Dabblet’s progress, follow that blog or [@dabblet](http://twitter.com/dabblet) on twitter.

That was also an excuse to finally try [tumblr](http://tumblr.com). So far, so good. I love how it gives you custom domains and full theme control for free (hosted Wordpress charges for those). Gorgeous, GORGEOUS interface too. Most of the themes have markup from the 2005-2007 era, but that was no surprise. I customized the theme I picked to make it more HTML5-ey and more on par with dabblet's style and it was super easy (though my attempt is by no means finished). There are a few shortcomings (like no titles for picture posts), but nothing too bad.
