I posted about this in both the [WebPlatform.org blog](http://blog.webplatform.org/2012/11/live-examples-coming-soon/) and [Dabblet’s blog](http://blog.dabblet.com/post/35203393585/lots-of-improvements-in-the-pipeline), but I thought it might be interesting to many readers of this blog as well:

> As many of you probably know, [I](http://lea.verou.me/)’ve started working for [W3C Developer Relations](http://www.w3.org/community/devrel/) since this August. Half of my time is devoted to [WebPlatform.org](http://www.webplatform.org/), a very promising project to document the web with the help of all major players, in a vendor-neutral way. Even before I joined [W3C](http://w3.org), we discussed using a hosted, customized version of [dabblet](https://dabblet.com) in WebPlatform.org, as a platform for live code examples. I recently started working towards making this happen.

> A lot of changes and improvements need to be made to achieve this, but the good news is, most of these will be pushed to dabblet.com as well! In a nutshell, this is what I’m currently working on:
>
> - Adding JavaScript support — This will be a challenge UX-wise, as it shouldn't run on every keystroke, like the HTML and CSS, but it should run on startup and it should be straight-forward how to get it to run. Perhaps it will also run after a significant pause in typing.
> - Dabblets that are not stored in Github, but get their data through POST requests.
> - Improving cross-browser support
> - Strengthening security
> - Integrating [Prism](http://prismjs.com/). Dabblet’s syntax highlighter might have been Prism’s precursor, but currently Prism has solved many of its bugs, and these fixes need to be pushed to dabblet at some point.
> - General bug fixing
>
> These will probably be gradually rolled out in dabblet.com and tested by the community, before we integrate dabblet into WebPlatform.org. If a new feature is significant enough, there will be a new blog post about it here, but don’t expect blog posts about bugfixes. I’m really excited to see dabblet flourish, and I believe you will be too, once these updates are out!
