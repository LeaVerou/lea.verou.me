[![multirange](images/multirange-300x206.png)](images/multirange.png)As part of my preparation for [my talk at CSSDay HTML Special](http://cssday.nl/2016/programme#lea-verou), I was perusing the most recent HTML specs ([WHATWG Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [W3C HTML 5.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/)) to see what undiscovered gems lay there. It turns out that HTML sliders have a lot of cool features specced that aren't very well implemented:

- Ticks that snap via the `list` attribute and the `<datalist>` element. This is fairly decently implemented, except labelled ticks, which is not supported anywhere.
- Vertical sliders when height > width, implemented nowhere (instead, browsers employ proprietary ways for making sliders vertical: An `orient=vertical` attribute in Gecko, `-webkit-appearance: slider-vertical;` in WebKit/Blink and `writing-mode: bt-lr;` in IE/Edge). Good ol' rotate transforms work too, but have the usual problems, such as layout not being affected by the transform.
- Two-handle sliders for ranges, via the `multiple` attribute.

I made a quick [testcase](https://dabblet.com/gist/0b79583e6e9c4e5e52aec5d682ac71d2) for all three, and to my disappointment (but not to my surprise), support was extremely poor. I was most excited about the last one, since I've been wanting range sliders in HTML for a long time. Sadly, there are no implementations. But hey, what if I could create a polyfill by cleverly overlaying two sliders? Would it be possible? I started [experimenting in JSBin](http://jsbin.com/risiki/edit?html,css,js,output) last night, just for the lolz, then soon realized this could actually work and [started a GitHub repo](https://github.com/leaverou/multirange). Since CSS variables are now supported almost everywhere, I've had a lot of fun using them. Sure, I could get broader support without them, but the code is much simpler, more elegant and customizable now. I also originally started with a [Bliss](http://blissfuljs.com) dependency, but realized it wasn't worth it for such a tiny script.

So, enjoy, and contribute!
