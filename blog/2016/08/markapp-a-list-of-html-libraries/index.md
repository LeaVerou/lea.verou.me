To encourage libraries with HTML APIs, i.e. libraries that can be used without writing a line of JS, I made a website to list and promote them: [markapp.io](http://markapp.io). The list is currently quite short, so I’m counting on you to [expand it](https://github.com/LeaVerou/markapp). Seen any libraries with good HTML APIs? Add them!
