About a year ago, [I announced I was joining W3C](http://lea.verou.me/2012/08/lea-at-w3-org/) as a full-time staff member, to work on Developer Relations and education. Working at [W3C](http://w3.org) was a dream come true and I can’t say I was disappointed. Over the past year I've worked with some amazingly brilliant people, hopefully increased awareness for web standards in the developer community and helped materialize the vision behind [WebPlatform.org](http://WebPlatform.org). It’s been a fun ride and working for a non-profit was very fulfilling. If somebody told me a year ago that I would decide to leave W3C on my own free will, I would’ve asked them what they were smoking. However, our future selves often surprise us and although it was the most difficult decision of my life, I recently decided to leave. July 31st will be my last day at W3C. I will attempt to describe the reasons below for anyone interested, but in no way does me leaving mean that I don't deeply appreciate W3C or that I regretted joining. If I could go a year back, I would make the same choice.

## Reason #1: I want to focus on other projects

I didn't have much time to work on my pet projects, as my job was consuming pretty much the entire me. **This is absolutely not W3C’s fault, it's mine** and a pretty common side effect of working from home. Pull requests kept piling up on Github, I didn't have many ideas for new side projects or time for research & to come up with new techniques. I was able to work a bit on [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com) and a [WPD Prism plugin](http://prismjs.com/plugins/wpd/), as they were useful for WebPlatform.org, but for the most part, I wanted to work more on open source projects, do more research, blog more etc. I also recently signed a book deal with [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/) for a book on advanced CSS techniques ("CSS Secrets", ETA Spring 2014) and I wanted to take some time off and write a great inaugural book, not just a decent one (and design it too!). I also kinda missed doing workshops or even client work, who knew!

Having more time will also mean I will be able to focus more on standards work, which is a huge passion of mine. I know it sounds odd to leave W3C to work more on ...standards, but standards work was never a part of my job at W3C. If I wanted to devote time to actively participate in the CSS WG beyond the weekly telcon, or to [the specification I edit](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds-4/), I would have to do it outside work hours. Obviously, I will still have to do it in my free time, but I recall having more of that when I was self-employed.

## Reason #2: I want to grow

I want to be in a job that’s a challenge, that helps me grow and become a better professional. While I appreciate [WebPlatform.org](http://WebPlatform.org), I didn’t feel that doing front-end development & design on it made me particularly better at what I do, at least compared to other things I could have been doing in the past year. It could be a perfect opportunity to grow for someone else, but it wasn’t for me.

I did become a better public speaker over the past year, but I would likely be doing as many talks anyway. I got some valuable conference organizing experience from [W3Conf](http://w3.org/conf), which I thoroughly enjoyed working on, but that was only a small part of my work.

## Reason #3: Different direction

Had I stayed, my job description for the upcoming year would have a slightly different focus. Since W3C Developer Relations was a new activity, neither Doug (my manager) nor I were quite sure how we could make the biggest impact, so we were experimenting to some degree. A few months after I joined, WebPlatform.org launched and we slowly concentrated our efforts on that. If I had stayed for another year, my job would have an even stronger [WebPlatform.org](http://WebPlatform.org) focus. Half of it would be front-end design & development and even writing documentation for a day per week. That meant I would have to cut down many parts of my job that I enjoyed and wanted to concentrate more on, such as public speaking and event planning, and though it includes some public-facing activities like gathering feedback from developers, I'd like to do even more of that. This was not a bad decision on W3C’s part — [WebPlatform.org](http://webplatform.org) needs somebody concentrating on those aspects of it. However, although I strongly believe in the vision behind the project, this was not what I would personally enjoy doing.

## Thank you, W3C

Even though I'm leaving W3C, it will always have a very special place in my heart. I met & worked with the most brilliant people I have ever met. Special mention to [Amy](http://twitter.com/amyvdh), who did not just prove to be an intelligent, interesting and kind person, but also a great friend in the past couple of weeks that I got to know her better. I got to visit [MIT](http://mit.edu) and work from there for a while, which was an incredible experience. I got to contribute to [WebPlatform.org](http://WebPlatform.org) which is a very ambitious and honorable project that I strongly believe in. I got to co-organize [W3Conf](http://w3.org/conf), which turned out to a successful and fun conference.

Me leaving is a personal decision that has less to do with W3C and more to do with what I want out of life. But I’m going to sorely miss the W3C Team, the culture, the technical discussions. It's been a fun ride and I'm grateful for the chance and the trust W3C placed in me. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself working for W3C again at some point in the future, in some way or in a different role.

But for now, here’s to the future! I'm thrilled.
