My name is Lea Verou[^lastname] (Lea being short for Michaelia or Μιχαήλια) and I’ve had a most unusual path,
albeit with a common theme: **making things that make it easier for people to make things** on the Web.

I work as **Product Lead** at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), so my day job is making it easier to create [awesome Web UIs](https://webawesome.com/), [for everyone](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/awesome/).

Previously, I spent a decade at [MIT](http://mit.edu) researching how to make web programming easier,
earning me a [**PhD** at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Programming Language Design](https://phd.verou.me),
with a minor in Entrepreneurship & Innovation [^business].
Alas, I wanted to work on products that ship and are used by real people, not research prototypes, so academia was not for me.

[^business]: The interest in business is longstanding — my undergrad alma mater was [Athens University of Economics and Business](http://aueb.gr/).

The combination of my **deep need to improve the usability of creator tools**
and my **audacious refusal to take the status quo for granted** led me to get involved in web standards,
as a means to improve the underlying technologies that power the Web.
I spent 4 years as an elected [W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Architecture_Group) member **reviewing proposed web technologies for usability and architectural consistency**,
and documenting the emerging patterns as [Web Platform Design Principles](https://w3.org/TR/design-principles/).
I have also been been one of the few Invited Experts of the [W3C CSS Working Group](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.en.php3) since 2012, and [co-edit several CSS specifications](https://lea.verou.me/publications/#specifications).
If you’re a Web developer, **you use bits of [my standards work](/specs/) daily**.

Building tools that make web making easier is not just work — it’s a passion.
As such, it has produced [dozens of side projects and open source tools](http://github.com/leaverou) _(I once counted over 50, though a third were either not yet released or soft launched)_.
Perhaps the two most popular ones are:
- [PrismJS](http://prismjs.com), a widely used syntax highlighter with [millions of weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) and ~1 **billion** total downloads),
- [Color.js](https://colorjs.io), a popular color manipulation library with over [10M npm downloads](https://limonte.dev/total-npm-downloads/?package=colorjs.io)

While secondary to making stuff, **I love sharing knowledge** (and blending the two by making educational tools).
In the past, I have…

- …[given over 100 invited talks at web conferences around the world](http://lea.verou.me/speaking),
- …written a [bestselling book on advanced CSS](http://www.amazon.com/CSS-Secrets-Lea-Verou/dp/1449372635?tag=leaverou-20) that was translated into 8 languages and dubbed ["Best CSS book"](https://www.chicagotribune.com/consumer-reviews/sns-bestreviews-electronics-the-best-css-book-20200701-kda2pyikobda5o3c4ivi4wzfui-story.html),
- …taught usability & web technologies at MIT, and co-created an [MIT course combining the two](https://designftw.mit.edu) that became a permanent subject
- …written several [articles](https://lea.verou.me/publications/#articles),
- …worked at [W3C/MIT](http://w3.org) as a Developer Advocate.

In the more distant past, I grew up in Lesbos, Greece [^lesbos], and started my career at the same time as my studies, in 2005.
For the first few years I freelanced across the whole spectrum, from traditional graphic design to full-stack web development.
In 2008 I **co-founded a startup** around a set of communities which at its peak, reached nearly **1% of the country’s population** as registered users.
I left the company in 2011 and it was sold in 2013.

[^lesbos]: I used to joke that this makes me _geographically Lesbian_.
I stopped making that joke when I realized that most people did not understand that ["Lesbian" literally means "person from Lesbos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian#Etymology) and thought I was simply making a pun. 🤦🏻

In typical ADHD fashion, I’m one of the few misfits who love (and have experience in) pretty much all aspects of product design:
product design, engineering, visual design, usability, even — gasp — marketing.

[^lastname]: _Until 2013 I officially had both my parents’ last names (Komvouti-Verou / Κομβούτη-Βέρου) though I had been going by Lea Verou for over a decade. In 2013 I finally did the paperwork to only keep my mother’s surname, for simplicity and brevity. I think it’s awesome that my parents left the choice up to me, and not the patriarchy, and I have strong opinions [on last name politics](https://pensieve.verou.me/post/40603145637/on-last-name-politics). Of course, my daughter also has both my and my husband’s last names._ 😊
